# BenefitsCalculator

This demo application allows a person (HR administrator) to enter employees and their family members to get a preview of how much the benefits will cost per year and per pay period.

Directions:
Download the zip file from GitHub, then view BenefitsCalculator.html in a browser (I was using Chrome when developing).

For two-way binding of data to form fields, Knockoutjs was used.

For formatting, bootstrap was used.
